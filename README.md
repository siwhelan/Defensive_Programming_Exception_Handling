# Defensive Programming - Exception Handling

A simple calculator application that asks a user to enter two numbers and the operation (e.g. +, -, x, etc.) that theyâ€™d like to perform on those numbers. Each equation is calculated, the result printed, and the entire equation is appended to a text file. 

Upon running the program, the user is asked if they would like to view all historical equations, if 'yes' the user is asked to input the name of the file they'd like to view, the contents of which are then printed to the console. If 'no', the program continues into the calculator itself. 

Throughout the program, mistakes in user input are anticipated, code is implemented to ensure the program does not crash, and the user is directed accordingly.
